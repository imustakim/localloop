# LocalLoop: Community-driven Local Event and Activity Platform (In Progress)

---

## üöß Project Status: In Progress üöß

LocalLoop is currently under active development. New features and improvements are being continuously integrated.

---

## üåü Project Concept

LocalLoop is an innovative, community-driven platform built with **Drupal 11** designed to connect individuals with local events and activities in their area. From concerts and fitness classes to community meetups and charity events, LocalLoop aims to be the go-to resource for discovering, organizing, and participating in local happenings.

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of advanced Drupal development, showcasing complex content modeling, robust user interactions, and dynamic system integrations.

## ‚ú® Key Features

LocalLoop offers a rich set of features to enhance the user experience:

* **Event Creation:** Event organizers can easily submit detailed event listings, including date, time, location (with geolocation), price, category, images, and organizer information. An optional admin approval workflow ensures quality control.
* **RSVP & Ticketing:** Users can RSVP to events, register their attendance, or purchase tickets directly through the platform.
* **Personalized Recommendations:** The system provides intelligent event recommendations based on user preferences, past activity, and geographic location.
* **Reviews & Ratings:** Attendees can leave feedback and rate events they've attended, fostering a more interactive and transparent community.
* **Advanced Search & Filtering:** A powerful search interface, powered by Search API and Facets, allows users to filter events by category, date range, price, location, and event type.
* **Geolocation Integration:** Interactive maps (powered by Google Maps API and potentially Leaflet Maps) display event locations, and users can find events near them based on their IP address or manual input.
* **Custom Event Calendar:** A dynamic calendar view allows users to browse upcoming events by month, week, or day, with color-coding for different categories.
* **User Dashboards:** Personalized dashboards provide logged-in users with a centralized place to track upcoming events, manage past activities, update profiles, and view recommended events.
* **Notifications & Reminders:** Automated email notifications inform users about upcoming events, new events in their interest categories, and solicit post-event feedback.
* **Robust User Role Management:** Distinct roles (Admin, Event Organizer, Regular User) are implemented with precise permissions to control access to specific functionalities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture & Implementation Highlights

LocalLoop leverages Drupal's powerful architecture to deliver a scalable and user-friendly platform:

### 1. Content Types & Relationships

* **Event:** The primary content type, featuring fields for name, description, date/time, location (Geolocation field), category (Taxonomy), price, image (Media field), organizer (User/Organizer content type reference), attendees (User reference), and tags. An approval workflow is integrated.
* **Organizer Profile:** A custom content type for event organizers, including fields for name, bio, contact info, and a reference to their organized events.
* **RSVP:** An Entity Reference linking users to events, tracking RSVP status.

### 2. User Interaction & Role Management

* **Roles:** Admin, Event Organizer, and Regular User roles with tailored permissions.
* **User Profiles:** Enhanced user profiles to track upcoming events, RSVPs, reviews, and custom fields for interests.

### 3. Search, Filters, & Recommendations

* **Search API & Facets:** Utilized for a highly customizable and efficient search experience.
* **Event Recommendations:** Logic based on user activity and location, with potential for machine learning integration via API.

### 4. Event Creation & Approval Workflow

* Custom submission form for organizers.
* **Workbench Moderation** or **Content Moderation** module for admin approval of new events.

### 5. Geolocation Integration

* **Geolocation module** and **Google Maps API** for displaying event locations and proximity searches.

### 6. Event RSVP & Ticketing System

* Custom RSVP functionality or integration with third-party services like Eventbrite API.
* Option for integrated payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe).

### 7. Review & Rating System

* Custom fields for 1-5 star ratings and text feedback.
* Moderation workflow for content quality.

### 8. Custom Event Calendar

* Built using **Views** with calendar formatting, color-coding by category, and hover-over details.

### 9. User Dashboard

* Personalized views for RSVP'd events, past events, profile management, and recommendations.

### 10. Notifications & Reminders

* Leveraging **Drupal's mail system** or modules like **Message** for email notifications.

## üìà Why This Project Stands Out

LocalLoop demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of Drupal's capabilities, including:

* **Complex Content Management:** Advanced use of content architecture, entity relationships, and taxonomy.
* **Dynamic User Interaction:** Implementation of user-generated content, robust role management, and personalized experiences.
* **Advanced Feature Integration:** Seamless integration of geolocation, payment gateways, recommendation systems, and custom workflows.
* **Custom Themable UI:** A focus on creating a polished, professional, and user-friendly interface using Drupal's theming layer (Twig templates).
* **User Engagement:** Features designed to encourage user interaction and retention.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

* **Create Content Types:** Define Events, Organizers, and RSVP types with appropriate fields.
* **Design Layouts:** Utilize Drupal's Block system to arrange event listings, recommendations, and calendars effectively.
* **Build Custom Modules:** Develop custom modules for specific functionalities like event approval workflows, RSVP management, and advanced email notifications.
* **Focus on Theming:** Prioritize a clean, responsive, and intuitive user experience through custom theming.
